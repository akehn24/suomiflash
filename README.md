# Finnish Language Learning Application

### To Do:
- Choose which language to show as vocab -> BLOCKED: need to figure out how to do multi-word translations
- List of exercises to choose from (all vocab, types of vocab, phrases, etc)
- Function file - is this possible? It should be...
- Exit button
- Top menu 
- Start menu


### Long-term To Do:
- Different modes -> Practice (doesn't end with incorrect answers) and Challenge (ends with incorrect answers, pop-up with score, etc.)
- Not just vocab -> translate phrases, enter response to prompt (ex: *How are you?* I'm good!)
- Conjugations -> not sure how I'd do these yet, just an idea
- Spoken vs. Written words


------
### Problems to Solve:
- Some words have more than one meaning (ex: Hän = He and She)
- Double-meaning words are going to break switching languages (ex: Yes = Joo and Kyllä)


------
### Finished:
- Add color to Correct/Incorrect
- Separate vocab lists into a separate file(s)
- Score counter
- Alter labels for readability
- Clear function
- Center app on screen
- Hover-over and click button animations
