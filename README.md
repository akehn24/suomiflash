# Finnish Language Learning Application

### Tools Used:
- Python
- Tkinter
- CSV
- Google Translate API

### To Do:
- Look into separate files - can I put the windows that aren't the title screen there? 
- Add box around text to menu 
- Hide menu screen while game is "running"
- Capitilize language names -> is this worth doing?

- Spoken vs. Written words -> WIP, not enough yet


### Long-term To Do:
- Different modes -> Practice (doesn't end with incorrect answers) and Challenge (ends with incorrect answers, pop-up with score, etc.)
- Not just vocab -> translate phrases, enter response to prompt (ex: *How are you?* I'm good!)
- Conjugations -> not sure how I'd do these yet, just an idea


------
### Problems to Solve:
- Some words have more than one meaning (ex: Hän = He and She)
- Double-meaning words are going to break switching languages (ex: Yes = Joo and Kyllä)


------
### Finished:
- Add color to Correct/Incorrect
- Separate vocab lists into a separate file(s)
- Score counter
- Alter labels for readability
- Clear function
- Center app on screen
- Hover-over and click button animations
- Start menu
- Exit button
- List of vocab to choose from
- Separate tab with GTranslate API 
- Notebook tab box fill the app screen
- Choose which language to show as vocab -> ISSUE: need to figure out how to do multi-word translations
